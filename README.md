# Toaster
A small application to send toast notifications in Windows.

#### When running with no arguments, an example toast will be sent.
#### You can create your own toasts by passing two strings for the title and context. Images are currently not supported.


## SmartScreen

Windows SmartScreen may block Toaster with a "Windows protected your PC" message.

If this happens:
1. Click **More info**
2. Click **Run anyway**

Toaster is open source, and youâ€™re welcome to inspect the code yourself.
